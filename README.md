# ALVIN.ai

Adaptive Learning Virtual Intelligence Nexus (ALVIN) is a webapp that helps teachers profile student's abilities via 
the use of adaptive learning technology. We project that this webapp is going to earn the 4 founding developers a total 
of $7,000 handsdown. We welcome any companies to purchase this idea at a small price of $400,000. Thank you.
